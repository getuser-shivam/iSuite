### Environment Setup

1. **Install Flutter:**
   ```bash
   # Download and install Flutter SDK from https://flutter.dev
   # Add Flutter to your PATH
   flutter doctor
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```env
   SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   AI_API_KEY=your_glm_api_key
   ```

### Build Commands

#### Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run on connected device
flutter run

# Run on specific platform
flutter run -d android
flutter run -d ios
flutter run -d windows
flutter run -d web
```

#### Production Builds

**Android APK:**
```bash
flutter build apk --release
# Output: build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

# Output: build/web/
```

#### Build Automation

Use the included Python GUI (`master_gui_app.py`) for automated building:

```bash
python master_gui_app.py
```

Features:
- Build for multiple platforms
- Error analysis and troubleshooting
- Build history and statistics
- Keyboard shortcuts and queue management

### Testing

#### Run Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run specific test file
flutter test test/widget/ai_assistant_screen_test.dart

# Run with coverage
flutter test --coverage
```

#### Code Analysis
```bash
# Analyze code for issues
flutter analyze

# Format code
flutter format lib/
```

### Deployment

#### Android (Google Play)
1. Build AAB: `flutter build appbundle --release`
2. Sign with Play Store key
3. Upload to Google Play Console
4. Configure store listing and publish

#### iOS (App Store)

#### Shared Preferences
User settings are automatically saved and restored across app restarts.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Flutter Doctor Warnings:**
```bash
flutter doctor --android-licenses
flutter doctor --ios-licenses
```

**Build Errors:**
- Clear cache: `flutter clean && flutter pub get`
- Update dependencies: `flutter pub upgrade`
- Check Flutter version compatibility

**Network Issues:**
- Verify internet connection
- Check firewall settings
- Validate API keys in `.env` file

**AI Features Not Working:**
- Verify GLM API key in settings
- Check internet connectivity
- Ensure API key has sufficient credits
